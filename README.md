# Minimal Blockchain

This implementation is my solution for an Blockchains assignment of my masters degree.
The goal was to implement a minimal version of a blockchain which does not include a client application.

## Prerequisites

* .NET 6 (used version: Preview 4)

## Instructions

To start the blockchain backend, execute `make` or `make run`.
Three requests are defined in the `requests.http` file, which are executable with the extensions `humao.rest-client`.
